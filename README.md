# AdventureGame
This is a scary text based adventure game which I had designed myself using Python. This was my first ever project I had done using Python and it had really made me understand the language a lot and in the future I plan to develop this game further by using an engine like Unity to make the game into a 3D GUI instead of being a text based game.

I used simple if, then statements and included many libraries such as pygame, OpenCV, Pyglet and Tkinter. With all of these libraries put together I managed to include jumpscares, stealing biometric information and also most importantly, made it so with every decision you have made results in a different outcome and I also included different random events that may or may not happen.

Please feel free to copy my code and save it into a python file and run the file through the command line of your computer. Enjoy!

(Also, any bugs within the code that you may find, please let me know thanks)
